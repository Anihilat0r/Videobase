# Videobase

  Videobase is a database manager for a virtual video club. It uses two categories of entities, "movies" and "users". 
The users are further divided into two sub categories "employees" and "customers".
  The data are stored in 3 individual .txt files that are created after the initial run. These files are named "movie_data"
, "customer_data" and "employee_data" with their values being updated before exiting the main menu.
